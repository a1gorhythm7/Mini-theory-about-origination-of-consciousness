## An imperfect proof

If this theorem hold, we can find the "Consciousness timeslice" or time binding window, and these window will alter if an causal entity(holds consciousness) enter a spacetime region where the flow of time is distorted(e.g. travelling near the speed c). Although this experiment is practically difficult (nearly impossible) to conduct in the current reality, an experiment (Scarpazza et al., 2022) has found that the Temporal Binding Window has a strong relation with the frequency of the Alpha wave. As this research can prove there exists a "Thickened Slice" $\text{Depth}(\mathcal{O}_t) \propto \tau_{\text{integration}}$ for consciousness in the causal net and the causal connectivity as self-consistency(the consciousness is quasi-continuous) in a certain degree, it had not fully proved that the strong link between the spacetime and the consciousness experience, as the Alpha-wave frequency is dominately defined by biological property of human, and have insufficient evidence that the Alpha wave have relation to the spacetime property in CST.
