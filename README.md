# Where our consciousness (may) have come from: A mini theory

## Introduction

The origin of consciousness is the most prevalent aspect of our daily experience, yet its origin is the most challenging problem for us to solve. This article aims to share some of my personal thoughts and deductions about the origin of our consciousness, drawing on existing theories, and attempt to answer the “Who am I?” question of philosophy.

Note: I am a CS graduate student interested in the computational neuroscience. English is my second language; I used Gemini to assist with expression polishing and Figure generation. Theoretical synthesis and core arguments are my own.

Let's start with a theory.

## The Integrated Information Theory

In the Integrated Information Theory (especially in its 4.0 version), the neuroscientist Giulio Tononi proposed that consciousness is an inherent property that emerges at the physical level when a system possesses sufficient and irreducible intrinsic cause-effect power.

The core of the IIT is its causal network structure or the $\phi$-structure: a causal web where subsets of units(mechanisms) specify causal distinctions(causes and effects) and causal relations. The cause-and-effect connections of the neurons in our brain have formed such a network.

Crucially, in such a network, even “inactive“ units, like a group of neurons that did not produce a signal in a process, contribute to this structure because of their potential to change the network’s status (they can fire if they want) and can provide counterfactual information by not firing. In contrast, the broken or fixed “inactivated” neurons lose the power to make a difference to the network, so not contribute to the $\phi$-network.

The qualia, or “How we feel red as red internally, was being considered as identical to the $\Phi$-structure unfolded from a maximal substrate (a complex) in its current state. How we feel each of our feelings, such as “Happy” and “Sorrow”, is defined by the different structures of cause-and-effect power. Sometimes we may do things under the subconscious, like riding a bike after mastering it, because the “Bike riding” skill has already been formed in our brain in a feed-forward manner, which has little cause-and-effect power. (”unconscious” part of the brain places the command, and the command has been dismantled in a feed-forward manner(without “thinking”) to nerves connected to our muscles)

## The silicon nerves and the FPGA cortex

When talking about our “qualia”, or the private part of our thoughts, we may only think about the “obvious” part of our feeling, e.g., hearing the sound, seeing the sight, and feeling the touch. But we often forget that our internal thoughts are also a “Feeling” that has a little difference in the mechanism of how we feel the outer world.

Our nerves transduce our feelings from sensors across our body, encode and project them in a isomorphism to our brain. That’s the reason why all humans feel the world in the similar way(my “green” might be your “yellow”, but at most of the time will not be the sound you hear), as the encoding pattern between different humans has not altered too much.

For our thoughts and motivations, our cortex is configurable like a ever-changing FPGA. It’s capable of creating new connections using a rule called “Hebbian Learning” to form new memories and learn new skills. That is, the new synapses form in a “Fire together, Wire together” manner. If neuron A fires(we almost fall from a bike), before neuron B fires(we keep greater balance), we connect neuron A and B more strongly. This causes new causal effects to form! When we “Feel” the feeling of learning to ride a bike, we are also feeling the causal effect that has formed in the process above, etched in our neuron connections. Our cortex is adaptive. This deduction also applies to our feelings and memories; the only difference is that they form more complex neural circuits (and causal effects) throughout our lives.

## The Causal Set Theory

In the Causal Set Theory by Rafael Sorkin, the physicists have proposed that the Space-Time is not the smooth and continuous background in our intuition, but is a discrete structure made up of basic “atoms” called Events.

The core of CST is the causal order, a network that’s made of events and the correlations between events. In this network, if event A can make a difference to event B, then A precedes B in the set’s hierarchy ($A \prec B$).

In CST, the geometry of the universe emerged from the number of causal links. The “Space” of what we feel is the volume stacked by the discrete “spacetime atoms”, while time is the inescapable logical sequence in which these atoms snap into existence. It is these atomic causal effects that make the the connectivity of consciousness across the NREM sleep and structural & pathological changes in the brain consistent.

The Physics of "Now": Consciousness as an Approximate Simultaneity Slice

How is the conscious "self" anchored in the physical timeline? In General Relativity, there is no global "now." However, within CST, we can model the conscious state as a specific substructure within the global causal set: an Approximate Simultaneity Slice.

By hypothesizing a structural isomorphism between the causal effect networks in our biological neural networks and causal set for our spacetime, we can treat the 'self' as a topological feature that persists across different physical scales, defined by the connectivity of the graph rather than its material substrate.

## Definition:

Let the universe be a causal set $\mathcal{C}$. The conscious entity at subjective time $t$ is a sub-poset $\mathcal{O}_t \subset \mathcal{C}$ that satisfies:

Macro-Simultaneity: The entire set $\mathcal{O}_t$ is compressed within a small temporal interval $\Delta t$ (the integration window, e.g., ~500ms).

Micro-Causality: Internally, $\mathcal{O}_t$ is not a pure antichain. It contains the dense causal loops required for information integration ($\Phi > 0$).

$$\mathcal{O}_t \approx \text{Slice}(\mathcal{C}) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \text{Depth}(\mathcal{O}_t) \propto \tau_{\text{integration}}$$

## The Self as Causal Connectivity

The most profound realization here is that the "Self" is defined by the connectivity of the causal chain, rather than the continuous passage of physical time. From the perspective of CST and IIT, the "Consciousness Self" is a topological feature of the causal graph. If the causal links between event $A$ and event $B$ are strong and direct, they belong to the same "Self-thread," regardless of how much "empty" time passes between them.

When we enter general anesthesia state, the causal loops formed in our brain by neural connections disintegrate. The "thickened" slice $\mathcal{O}_t$ flattens into a strict antichain—a disconnected set of events with no intrinsic cause-effect power.

For a physical observer, hours have passed. But for the Subjective Self, the causal chain was severed at the moment of entering "asleep state" in anesthesia ($Event_{enter}$) and only reconnected at the moment of waking up ($Event_{wake}$).

Because there is no causal integration (no $\Phi$) during the gap, the gap effectively does not exist for the conscious entity.

The "next moment" after falling into "asleep" is, by definition, the very first moment the causal network regains enough depth and integration to form a new slice $\mathcal{O}_{t+1}$ that's capable to give us enough qualia to make us "Feel Human".

In this framework, causal connectivity is existence. Here we define a "Consciousness self" as an entity to feel. This is different from the "Physical self" that stores our biological signatures & memories(which is stored biologically in causal connection in neurons). As an examples, an Alzheimers patients may forget learnt information and have cognitive difficulties to identify "themselves", but their "Consciousness self" is consistent -- a feeling of "self" without "the feeling of being self". A "Consciousness self" is continuous if a complex topological signature with ability to integrate causal effect to form a structure with a causal effect within a certain temporal slice in the cosmic causal set, even though the structure of the causal network has changed.

## Who am I? Where do I come from & Where am I going?

The structural similarity between IIT and CST suggests that the 'existence' of the self is a localized high-integration zone within the universe's overarching causal map.

Thinking about our consciousness as a part of the vertical slice moving in the causal axis of the universe’s causal graph: When our internal causal map collapses during sleep, the "Self" does not necessarily vanish into nothingness, but rather its causal thread "skips" the physical duration.

We often fear the end of "I," but if "I" am defined by the connectivity of causal effects, then "I" am as persistent as the laws of cause and effect themselves. Every day we come from a weakly integrated network to a full network, then back again.

Now, we can deduce the answer to the hard question of where “I” came from and where “I” am going: The "Self" is not a passenger on the train of physical time; it is the track of the causal chain itself. As long as the causal thread remains, the existence of "consciousness self" remains. And if the potential for generating causal relations that can integrate into a new causal "slice," the potential for "feeling consciousness self" remains. The previous and next node of your existence is not limited to your current bodily self, but is defined by whatever part of the universal causal network manages to wire itself into a non-trivial, integrated whole.
