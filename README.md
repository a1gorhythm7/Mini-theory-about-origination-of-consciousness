# Where our consciousness (may) have come from: A mini theory

## Introduction

Consciousness is the most prevalent aspect of our daily experience, yet its origin is the most challenging problem for us to solve. This article aims to share some of my personal thoughts and deductions about the origin of our consciousness, drawing on existing theories, and attempt to answer the “Who am I?” question of philosophy.

A small confession before we dive in: I spend my days coding at the university, not dissecting brains. I’m a CS grad student with a "gut feeling" and a lot of questions. Some of the ideas in this piece are my own theories and not experiment-proven scientific facts. While I’ve done my best to explore these concepts, I can’t guarantee their correctness. Use this info at your own discretion — I’m not responsible for how you choose to apply these thoughts or any results that follow! Read it with a healthy dose of curiosity and a pinch of salt.

Let's start with a theory.

## The Integrated Information Theory

In the Integrated Information Theory (especially in its 4.0 version), the neuroscientist Giulio Tononi proposed that consciousness is an inherent property that emerges at the physical level when a system possesses sufficient and irreducible intrinsic cause-effect power.

The core of the IIT is its causal network structure or the /phi -structure: a causal web where subsets of units(mechanisms) specify causal distinctions(causes and effects) and causal relations. The cause-and-effect connections of the neurons in our brain have formed such a network.

Crucially, in such a network, even “inactive“ units, like a group of neurons that did not produce a signal in a process, contribute to this structure because of their potential to change the network’s status (they can fire if they want) and can provide counterfactual information by not firing. In contrast, the broken or fixed “inactivated” neurons lose the power to make a difference to the network, so not contribute to the /phi- network.

The qualia, or “How we feel red as red internally, was being considered as identical to the $\Phi$-structure unfolded from a maximal substrate (a complex) in its current state. How we feel each of our feelings, such as “Happy” and “Sorrow”, is defined by the different structures of cause-and-effect power. Sometimes we may do things under the subconscious, like riding a bike after mastering it, because the “Bike riding” skill has already been formed in our brain in a feed-forward manner, which has little cause-and-effect power. (”unconscious” part of the brain places the command, and the command has been dismantled in a feed-forward manner(without “thinking”) to nerves connected to our muscles)

In brief, right now, our feelings are the causes and effects in our brains. But how are those causes and effects formed to make our feelings(the “qualia”) in the state we are feeling now? How can we feel our internal states and memories?

## The silicon nerves and the FPGA cortex

When talking about our “qualia”, or the private part of our thoughts, we may only think about the “obvious” part of our feeling, e.g., hearing the sound, seeing the sight, and feeling the touch. But we often forget that our internal thoughts are also a “Feeling” that has a little difference in the mechanism of how we feel the outer world.

Our nerves transduce our feelings from sensors across our body, encode and project them in a isomorphism to our brain. That’s the reason why all humans feel the world in the similar way(my “green” might be your “yellow”, but at most of the time will not be the sound you hear), as the encoding pattern between different humans has not altered too much.

For our thoughts and motivations, our cortex is configurable like a ever-changing FPGA. It’s capable of creating new connections using a rule called “Hebbian Learning” to form new memories and learn new skills. That is, the new synapses form in a “Fire together, Wire together” manner. If neuron A fires(we almost fall from a bike), before neuron B fires(we keep greater balance), we connect neuron A and B more strongly. This causes new causal effects to form! When we “Feel” the feeling of learning to ride a bike, we are also feeling the causal effect that has formed in the process above, etched in our neuron connections. Our cortex is adaptive(By rerouting visual signals into the auditory cortex of newborn ferrets, scientists demonstrated that the brain is a highly adaptable processor capable of redefining its function based on the input it receives.). This deduction also applies to our feelings and memories; the only difference is that they form more complex neural circuits (and causal effects) throughout our lives.

In general, everything we feel, including what we see, what we know, and what we remember, is the same in the underlying principles.

But how has our consciousness been grounded to earth? Let’s continue with another theory.

## The Causal Set Theory

In the Causal Set Theory by Rafael Sorkin, the physicists have proposed that the Space-Time is not the smooth and continuous background in our intuition, but is a discrete structure made up of basic “atoms” called Events.

The core of CST is the causal order, a network that’s made of events and the correlations between events. In this network, if event A can make a difference to event B, then A precedes B in the set’s hierarchy.

In CST, the geometry of the universe emerged from the number of causal links. For example, the spacetime volume was defined by the total count of events, while the pattern of connections dictates the “feel” of its dimensions.  The “Space” of what we feel is the volume stacked by the discrete “spacetime atoms”, while time is the inescapable logical sequence in which these atoms snap into existence.

## The Topological Signature of Integrated Information

Instead of viewing consciousness as a static property, we propose it corresponds to the dynamic topology of the system's causal structure. We model the neural network as a Directed Simplicial Complex, denoted as $\mathcal{K}$.

The qualitative structure of experience (Qualia), $Q$, is hypothesized to be homomorphic to the persistent homology of the causal subgraph activated within the integration time window $\tau$:

$$Q \cong \mathcal{PH}_* \left( \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}_{\text{macro}}) \right)$$

Where:

$\mathcal{C}_{\text{macro}}$ is the macroscopic causal structure derived from the underlying Causal Set via coarse-graining.

$\mathcal{F}$ represents a Filtration process (e.g., filtering by synaptic weight $w$ or causal strength).

$\mathcal{PH}_*$ denotes Persistent Homology, which captures the birth and death of topological features across scales.

The richness of the experience is quantified by the Betti Numbers ($\beta_k$) of the complex:

$\beta_0$: Connected components (Integration). High $\Phi$ implies $\beta_0 \to 1$.

$\beta_1$: Causal loops (Re-entrant circuits/Information recurrence).

$\beta_k$ ($k \ge 2$): High-dimensional cavities (Information differentiation).

Hypothesis: The specific "feeling" of a qualia (e.g., "Redness") corresponds to a specific topological signature—a stable high-dimensional cavity ($\beta_k > 0$) that persists through the filtration parameter space. Sleep or unconsciousness corresponds to a topological collapse, where the complex simplifies, and high-dimensional Betti numbers vanish ($\beta_{k \ge 2} \to 0$).

## Who am I? Where do I come from & Where am I going?

You may find the point as the IIT and CST seems to share a striking topological resemblance. While those theories seemingly works on vastly different timescales of causal effects, the structural similarity between these two theories suggests the same fundamental principle of the ‘existence’ might be structured. Within the CST framework, the current 'conscious self' can be approximately viewed as a part of the approximate simultaneity slice (may include a little part before & after it, not “perfectly” flat) of the universe’s overarching causal map.

It’s hard to trace the origin before the memory of “I” forms(born) or vanishes(death). But we may find some clues in what we do(almost) daily.

During NREM sleep, while neurons are still active, their firing patterns become highly synchronized and bistable. According to IIT, this reduces the system's capacity for information differentiation, causing the $\Phi$-structure to simplify or collapse, which makes us unconscious. But when we wake up in the morning of the second day, we feel we “return” to our body.  This may indicate that when we are asleep, we put a causal thread of of our consciousness somewhere.

But where?

Thinking about our consciousness as a part of the vertical slice moving in the causal axis of the universe’s causal graph in CST. When our causal map collapses, the size of our causal graph in the entire graph’s slice has shrunk to an extremely small size. The size that can not even contain the qualia of “time” and “self” — When we are asleep, we are not experiencing nothing, but experiencing an experience close to what is called “protoconsciousness”.

Every day in my life, I came from a weakly integrated network to a soon-to-be-built full network, then went back to a weakly integrated network again.

Now, we can deduce the hard question of where “I” came from and where “I” am going, as the previous and next node is not limited to your current bodily self, but the full causal network of the universe.
